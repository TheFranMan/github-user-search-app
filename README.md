## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

   * Learned how to use React hooks `useContext`, `useReducer`, and `useEffect`.
   * Further increased my knowlage on how React uses state to rerender a page.
   * This was also my first project using CSS Grid. Bit of a learning curve, but I got there in the end.
   * Implemented `prefers-color-scheme` in js to create a dark/light mode switcher.
